### Refresh the Glitch page to see different arrangements of these deranged cubes.

### They're really not well.

  

## The Hell is This?

  

Goofy, yes. Messing around in a time of crisis.

Watching governor's livestream. Cuomo's brother is infected. Found out last night. Personal side of the governor. This shit's intense.

"Sweet guy. But now he's quarantined in the basement."

### So, yeah ...

A sketch I did while not sleeping ... initially because I was stressed out about the armageddon we're currently inhabiting, but also because I wanted to get back to work. So I did.

So this is noisy af.  
My first step into the A-Frame universe. For those who don't know:

WebXR it is. It's a full on VR space running on your desktop, or phone, or headset. It doesn't really care.  
And I'm not coding this in C#. 

### What I was trying to do ...

What I was trying to do was to get randomly placed elements arranged programmatically in space. 

Started out just playing with the arame particle-system, then moved to objects based on some design i came across while developing.  

It wasn't at all interesting, so i had to add some animation. And when those animations were identical across all elements, I had to add still more randomness to the mix. And Voila! Agitated pink things spinning over an oil slick with ping pong electrons flitting about. Whatever. 

Fun, actually.

Please don't take this seriously. I don't. There's already enough serious shit out there right now. Wait with me for Godot in Sarajevo.
